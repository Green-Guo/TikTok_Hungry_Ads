{"input_prompt": "\n        \nYour role involves determining a similarity score between advertisements from two distinct markets, each represented by two ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. For example, 'US' corresponds to the United States market, and 'NZ' represents the New Zealand market. Your tasks are outlined as follows:\n\n1) Code Conversion: Begin by translating the two codes into their respective market names.\n2) Decision Making: Calculate a similarity score for advertisements originating from these two markets, primarily considering language and cultural factors. For instance, if 'CN' refers to China and 'US' to the United States, the similarity score between their advertisements should be relatively low. This is because China and the United States have markedly different cultures and languages.\n3) Logical Reasoning: Provide a brief explanation for the chosen similarity scores based on language and cultural disparities.\n4) Output Format: Present your decisions in the following format:\"\n\n        The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing \"```json\" and \"```\":\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"Name\": string  // Return the country names that corresponds to the given two codes. For instance, if <US> is given as Code 1 and                              <CN> is given as Code 2 you should then return [United States, China].Enclosed the list items with []\n\t\"Reason\": string  // A short logical reason on why you generate such similarity score                                         after considering from the language and culture perspectives. \n\t\"Decision\": string  // A similarity score ranging from 0 to 1 which is used to measure the resemblance between advertisements created by different marketers. For instance, countries like the US and AU, which share the same language and have similar cultures, might yield a high similarity score, say 0.9, as their advertisements may have similar content and style. Conversely, countries like CN and US, with different languages and cultures, may result in a lower similarity score, such as 0.1, indicating that their advertisements are quite dissimilar.\n}\n```\n        <Code 1: US>\n        <Code 2: JP>\n        \n        ", "output_fromGPT": "```json\n{\n\t\"Name\": [\"United States\", \"Japan\"],\n\t\"Reason\": \"The United States and Japan have different primary languages (English and Japanese, respectively) and distinct cultural backgrounds.
